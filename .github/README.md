[![Deploy Hugo site to Pages](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/sauravmaheshkar.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/sauravmaheshkar.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yaml)

Source code for my personal website based on the [papermod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme with some modifications from the original theme:
* Most of my articles are on external sites, so I added a [new layout](../layouts/posts/external-redirect.html) to redirect posts to external links.
* I had to modify some of the code for the introduction section to make markdown lists work properly.
* Instead of showing all the articles on the home page as is the default with the theme I only wanted to showcase some highlighted articles as per my choice.
