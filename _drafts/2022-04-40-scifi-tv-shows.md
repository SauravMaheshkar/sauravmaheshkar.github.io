An ongoing list of all the Sci-Fi TV Shows and Movies I have watched over the years and my thoughts on some of them

# TV Shows

* Brave New World [dystopian]
    * The city looks amazing !!! Lots of greenery, probably a ecuemonopolis, amazing ecology
    * Monogamous == Shame ?! Interesting
    * Jealousy and Possesiveness of one's partner is frowned upon
    * "No Privacy, No Family, No Monogamy"
    * Implants in one eye (control the environment and sync them to "Indra", I think it's some sorta connected social network. There's a clear anthropomorphism going on, maybe she's an AI, it's really apparent she's an AI. The founders ran the network and went to some sorta sleep, and woke when she created the perfect world)
    * Normal Life is an Amusement Park ?
    * Pills to control hormone levels of the general public
    * Lots of Sober colours and monochrome outfits
    * Clear dependence on Pills (Are they bought ? Freely available? Who manufactures them and how is it paid for?)
    * What about Natural Hormone levels ? ig that's what the pills are for
    * Lots of holograms (commercials, conversations, transactions)
    * They stopped making music !! (Grim Grim world)
    * Most Dangerous thing a man can be is romantic -- Dayum Nice
    * Privacy os also frowned upon
    * "Solipsism" Word Drop ! And now that I think of it, is the central part of this Bernard guy, no it's a central point of the entire show
    * Launch platform out in the sea ... Hmm SpaceX much ? Looks a lot like the intercontinental ship that SpaceX had proposed.
    * Very apparent Pyramidal Soceity based on Class. It's just that the class names are a bit scientific so ig that makes it better somehow
    * There's no parenthood in the New World ?! Seems like they're engineered embryos. Hmm there missing a beautiful part of life
    * Very Hilarious description of a Marriage
    * Some women carry the grace that requires metaphor
    * This revolution that the "Savages" are doing it's nothing more than a cult. That's a bit poetic isn't it ? An actual true display of the savageness that's apparent in this world of ours
    * Hmm seems like these engineered female humans are also capable of giving birth
    * Hmm seems like they've supressed pain with those "Soma" pills
    * They drink from test tubes ?! (Vacuum sealed apparently), I haven't seen them eat ! They drink everything, tbh I lke that. I always thought chewing to be a bit tiresome but then again how can one appreciate the texture of food without chewing 
    * It's based on a book !! ig there's something to add to the reading list
    * Engineered a way to be Happy always
    * There's a severe lack of alcohol
    * There's a conception that Fear defines humans our actions, customs, traditions, obsessions and inventions.
    * Is all of this a simulation ??!!
    * The most beautiful sight on this planet, each other
    * Humans have an innate need of being unhappy ?? That became serious too fast
    * So the AI thinks monogomy is stupid ?
    * They're desperate for emotions ?!
    * So it's an AI that exists in the clouds of human consciousness
    * So, mass murder just happened. WTF ! Can they even air this ? I mean I've seen it before but it makes me think there must be some laws right ?
    * Beautiful vision of terraforming
    * So this guy becomes another cult leader
    * Wow, so apparently this is based on a book which came out in 1958 !! Aldous Huxley what a visionary, I need to read this I really do
    * Now I'm hooked on to behavioural sciences, this is very very interesting. Aldous Huxley is now my new man crush
