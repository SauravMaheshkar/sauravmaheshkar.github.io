# Introduction to Named Entity Recognition

## Introduction

Named entity recognition(NER) is the task to identify mentions of rigid designators from text belonging to predefined semantic types such as person, location, organization etc. NER always servers as the foundation of many natural language applications such as question answering, text summarization, and machine translation.

Despite the various definitions of NE(Named Entity), researchers have reached common consensus on the types of NEs to recognize. We generally divide NEs into two categories:

* **Generic NEs:** Person and Location
* **Domain-specific NEs:** proteins, enzymes, and genes.

4 mainstream approaches used in NER are:

* **Rule-Based Approaches:** Don’t need annotated data as they rule on hand-crafted rules
* **Unsupervised Learning Approaches:** Rely on unsupervised algorithms without hand-labelled training examples
* **Feature-based Supervised Learning:** Rely on supervised algorithms with a lot of feature engineering involved
* **Deep Learning Approaches:** Automatically discover representations from raw input

## Formal Definition

A named entity (NE) is a word or a phrase that clearly identifies one item from a set of other items that have similar attributes. Examples being organizations, person, location names. NER is the process of locating and classifying named entities in text into predefined entity categories.

Formally, given a sequence of tokens $ s = {w_1,w_2,…,w_N} $, NER outputs a list of tuples $ {I_s, I_e, t} $, each of which is a named entity mentioned in $ s $. Here, $ I_s \in [1, N] $ and $ I_e \in [1, N] $ are the start and end indexes of a NER; t is an entity type from a predefined category set.

## Evaluation

NER systems are usually evaluated by comparing their outputs against human annotations. The comparison can be quantified by either exact-match or relaxed match.

## Deep Learning Techniques for NER

There are three core strengths of applying deep learning techniques to NER.
1. NER benefits from the non-linear transformations, which generates non-linear mappings from input to output. DL models are able to learn complex and intricate features from data compared to linear models (log-linear HMM, linear chain CRF).
2. DL saves a significant amount of effort on designing NER features. The traditional models required a considerable amount of engineering skill and domain expertise.
3. Deep NER models can be trained on an end-to-end paradigm which enables us to build complex NER systems.

## General Deep Learning Architecture for NER

* **Distributed representations for input** consider word- and character-level embeddings as well as the incorporation of additional features.
* **Context encoder** is to capture the context dependencies using CNN, RNN, or other networks.
* **Tag decoder** predicts tags for tokens in the input sentence.

# Introduction to Transformers

## Motivation

Traditional architectures like Recurrent Neural Network or Convolutional Neural Networks ( where we use encoders to encode sentences into representations and then decode these representations into our desired format ) for sequence transduction tasks ( language modelling and machine translation ) have shown promising results but they are affected by long sequence lengths. Although using conditional computations and certain factorisation tricks have resulted in increased computational efficiency but the constraints of sequence computation still remain. Thus, this new architecture relies entirely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output sequences.

Using self-attention we can:
* Reduce the Computational Complexity per layer
* Parallelize more computations
* Capture long-range dependencies effectively

## The Architecture

As mentioned earlier, the earlier neural sequence transduction models had an encoder-decoder structure. Where the encoder mapped an input sequence $ (x_1, ..., x_n) $ into a sequence of representations $ z = (z_1, ..., z_n) $ and then given $z$ , the decoder generates an output $ (y_1, ..., y_n) $. As the model is auto-regressive in nature, it takes as input the previously generated symbols as an additional input.

## Attention: Scaled Dot-Product

$ Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V $

The inputs are:

* queries and keys of dimensions $ d_k $
* values of dimensions $ d_v $
# Implementing NER using Trax

Install the latest version of the [Trax](https://github.com/google/trax) Library.

```python
!pip install -q -U trax
```

## Importing Packages

```python
import trax # Our Main Library
from trax import layers as tl
import os # For os dependent functionalities
import numpy as np # For scientific computing
import pandas as pd # For basic data analysis
import random as rnd # For using random functions
```

## Pre-Processing

Let's load the `ner_dataset.csv` file into a dataframe and see what it looks like

```python
data = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/entity-annotated-corpus/ner_dataset.csv",encoding = 'ISO-8859-1')
data = data.fillna(method = 'ffill')
data.head()
```

We can see there's a column for the words in each sentence. Thus, we can extract this column using the `.loc()` and store it into a `.txt` file using the `.savetext()` function from numpy.

```python
## Extract the 'Word' column from the dataframe
words = data.loc[:, "Word"]

## Convert into a text file using the .savetxt() function
np.savetxt(r'words.txt', words.values, fmt="%s")
```

Here, we create a Dictionary for our vocabulary by reading through all the sentences in the dataset.

```python
vocab = {}
with open('words.txt') as f:
  for i, l in enumerate(f.read().splitlines()):
    vocab[l] = i
  print("Number of words:", len(vocab))
  vocab['<PAD>'] = len(vocab)
```

For extracting sentences from the dataset and creating `(X,y)` pairs for training.

```python
class Get_sentence(object):
    def __init__(self,data):
        self.n_sent=1
        self.data = data
        agg_func = lambda s:[(w,p,t) for w,p,t in zip(s["Word"].values.tolist(),
                                                     s["POS"].values.tolist(),
                                                     s["Tag"].values.tolist())]
        self.grouped = self.data.groupby("Sentence #").apply(agg_func)
        self.sentences = [s for s in self.grouped]

getter = Get_sentence(data)
sentence = getter.sentences

words = list(set(data["Word"].values))
words_tag = list(set(data["Tag"].values))

word_idx = {w : i+1 for i ,w in enumerate(words)}
tag_idx =  {t : i for i ,t in enumerate(words_tag)}

X = [[word_idx[w[0]] for w in s] for s in sentence]
y = [[tag_idx[w[2]] for w in s] for s in sentence]
```

Here, we create a batch generator for training.

```python
def data_generator(batch_size, x, y,pad, shuffle=False, verbose=False):

    num_lines = len(x)
    lines_index = [*range(num_lines)]
    if shuffle:
        rnd.shuffle(lines_index)

    index = 0
    while True:
        buffer_x = [0] * batch_size
        buffer_y = [0] * batch_size

        max_len = 0
        for i in range(batch_size):
            if index >= num_lines:
                index = 0
                if shuffle:
                    rnd.shuffle(lines_index)

            buffer_x[i] = x[lines_index[index]]
            buffer_y[i] = y[lines_index[index]]

            lenx = len(x[lines_index[index]])    
            if lenx > max_len:
                max_len = lenx                  

            index += 1

        X = np.full((batch_size, max_len), pad)
        Y = np.full((batch_size, max_len), pad)


        for i in range(batch_size):
            x_i = buffer_x[i]
            y_i = buffer_y[i]

            for j in range(len(x_i)):

                X[i, j] = x_i[j]
                Y[i, j] = y_i[j]

        if verbose: print("index=", index)
        yield((X,Y))
```

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size = 0.1,random_state=1)
```

## Building the Model

We will perform the following steps:

* Use input tensors from our data generator

* Produce Semantic entries from an Embedding Layer

* Feed these into our Reformer Language model

* Run the Output through a Linear Layer

* Run these through a log softmax layer to get predicted classes

We use the:

* `tl.Serial():` Combinator that applies layers serially(by function composition). It's commonly used to construct deep networks. It uses stack semantics to manage data for its sublayers

* `tl.Embedding():` Initializes a trainable embedding layer that maps discrete tokens/ids to vectors

* `trax.models.reformer.Reformer():` Creates a Reversible Transformer encoder-decoder model.

* `tl.Dense():` Creates a Dense(fully-connected, affine) layer

* `tl.LogSoftmax():` Creates a layer that applies log softmax along one tensor axis.

```python
def NERmodel(tags, vocab_size=35181, d_model = 50):

  model = tl.Serial(
    # tl.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model),
    trax.models.reformer.Reformer(vocab_size, d_model, ff_activation=tl.LogSoftmax),
    tl.Dense(tags),
    tl.LogSoftmax()
  )

  return model

model = NERmodel(tags = 17)
```
## Train the Model

```python
from trax.supervised import training

rnd.seed(33)

batch_size = 64

train_generator = trax.data.inputs.add_loss_weights(
    data_generator(batch_size, x_train, y_train,vocab['<PAD>'], True),
    id_to_mask=vocab['<PAD>'])

eval_generator = trax.data.inputs.add_loss_weights(
    data_generator(batch_size, x_test, y_test,vocab['<PAD>'] ,True),
    id_to_mask=vocab['<PAD>'])
```
```python
def train_model(model, train_generator, eval_generator, train_steps=1, output_dir='model'):
    train_task = training.TrainTask(
      train_generator,  
      loss_layer = tl.CrossEntropyLoss(),
      optimizer = trax.optimizers.Adam(0.01),
      n_steps_per_checkpoint=10
    )

    eval_task = training.EvalTask(
      labeled_data = eval_generator,
      metrics = [tl.CrossEntropyLoss(), tl.Accuracy()],
      n_eval_batches = 10
    )

    training_loop = training.Loop(
        model,
        train_task,
        eval_tasks = eval_task,
        output_dir = output_dir)

    training_loop.run(n_steps = train_steps)
    return training_loop
```
